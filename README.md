# Shopping-Cart-Web-App

This shopping cart web app looks and feels like an actual app on mobile devices. It allows users to add items to the shopping cart add the remove the items from shopping cart by double tapping on the item. (I have disable my firebase, other people wont be able to add items to my database)


Knowledge that has been used to finish this personal roject:
- Firebase(initializeApp, getDatabase, reference, push, onValue, remove methods)
- createElement
- Setting viewport(it controls how webpage gets display on mobile devices)
- Favicon
- Web Application Manifest(JSON file that determines how your app looks and behaves once installed on a user's desktop or mobile device)
